This is my first python project. I got the task from FreeCodeCamp and added an addition function to validate if the format is correct
Later on I will also add a CLI Flag so the program becomus more usable and the problems aren't hard-coded.
Also makes it more unique. 
Because I am only starting to learn the basics i am appreciative of any tips that could improve my stuff. (But keep it simple)
